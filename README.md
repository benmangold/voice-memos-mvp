[Delployed Application (Desktop Only)](https://floating-ocean-16339.herokuapp.com/)

React - Node.js - MongoDb

A minimum viable product demonstration of a full-stack voice memo application

This application allows the user to add voicememos to a database, and then access those memos as they are rendered dynamically in the application UI

Audio recording and WAV encoding occurs in-browser
